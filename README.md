### 多What's Coraline?
Coraline Project is an IOT project, who aims to give everyone tools for creating **interactive educative content** *(IEC)*, giving to the teachers and students a dynamic environment for learning.

### 多What do i need to install?

Coraline is made to be **very** versatile, you will only need to install and run [coraline-educative](https://github.com/CamiloTD/coraline-educative) in one **nodejs** compatible device, the connecting devices will **NOT** need to install **ANYTHING**, they will be able to interact without installing anything, using only their **Web Browser**

##### NOTE THAT JUST ONE *CORALINE-EDUCATIVE* CAN GIVE ACCESS TO A ENTIRE CLASSROOM, AND MORE! WITHOUT INSTALLING ANYTHING ELSE IN ANY CONNECTING DEVICES!

### Getting into the matter

In the simplest case, a Coraline Environment is just a **HTML5** content that is being controled by one or more devices at the same time.

But also, **Coralines** are pretty versatile, and you can use any *HTML5* device as main screen, for example, another smartphone:

*Using Smartphone as main screen*
